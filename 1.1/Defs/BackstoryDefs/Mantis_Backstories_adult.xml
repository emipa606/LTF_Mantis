		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] used to be part of a pirate ship crew. [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_possessive] crewmates often found themselves awakened by strange sounds. A few disparitions occured and the captain was always evasive about what happened. A paranoia atmosphere settled down. After too many months of an overcautious daily life, threatened by a nameless danger, [PAWN_nameDef] managed to escape the ship and [PAWN_possessive] fears.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had to correct [PAWN_possessive] past financial mistakes. [PAWN_pronoun] found a very physical and exhausting opportunity [PAWN_pronoun] could not afford to refuse in an overcrowded city. [PAWN_pronoun] found a cheap appartment, but was unaware of the consequences that come with cheap prices. [PAWN_possessive] neighbor enjoyed having fun and did not care who was listening. Every night he had a new partner. Every night [PAWN_nameDef] had to go through grunts, strident scratches, moanings without even having the strength nor willpower to make them stop. [PAWN_pronoun] ended up becoming very attached to decent living conditions and disgusted with his own race animality.</baseDescription>

They figured out it would be handier to erase [PAWN_possessive] memories about the company critical details instead of repairing the mess they did with [PAWN_possessive] body. [PAWN_nameDef] got thrown into the outside world with a few after-effects.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>A rogue scientist infected [PAWN_nameDef]'s hive mind. The only people with the capability of stopping him were those whose mental states were already damaged before the attack. [PAWN_nameDef] was the least qualified out of all the mental patients to enter the dreamscape. A virtual reality embedded within a fungus network that kept the hive social links as a backup but got deeply altered by the infection. [PAWN_nameDef] achieved what none of his pairs could and restored the hive social links. [PAWN_pronoun] got banned from [PAWN_possessive] community for his efforts because everybody felt [PAWN_pronoun] had an awkward ascendancy over them.</baseDescription>

It's a known tale that the comet itself holds unlimited powers, cursed by an ancestral mantis hive ruler. This time, when the comet could be seen for 13 days, [PAWN_nameDef] felt like [PAWN_pronoun] got engulfed by its light and message for [PAWN_objective].
