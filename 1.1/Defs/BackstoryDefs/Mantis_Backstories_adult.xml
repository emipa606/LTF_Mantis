		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] used to be part of a pirate ship crew. [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_possessive] crewmates often found themselves awakened by strange sounds. A few disparitions occured and the captain was always evasive about what happened. A paranoia atmosphere settled down. After a too many months of an overcautious daily life, threatened by a nameless danger, [PAWN_nameDef] managed to escape the ship and [PAWN_possessive] fears.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had to correct [PAWN_possessive] past financial mistakes. [PAWN_pronoun] found a very physical and exhausting opportunity [PAWN_pronoun] could not afford to refuse in an overcrowded city. [PAWN_pronoun] found a cheap appartment, but was unaware of the consequences that come with cheap prices. [PAWN_possessive] neighbor enjoyed having fun and did not care who was listening. Every night he had a new partner. Every night [PAWN_nameDef] had to go through grunts, strident scratches, moanings without even having the strength nor willpower to make them stop. [PAWN_pronoun] ended up becoming very attached to decent living conditions and disgusted with his own race animality.</baseDescription>
